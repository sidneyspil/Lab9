# Reliability
```{r}
#Option 1: 
#The traditional way is to recode your items first, then use the recoded items to test reliability

lab9data$FSMI3_R <- 8 - lab9data$FSMI3 #recoding reverse coded - use 8 bc scale is 1 to 7 
#lab9data$FSMI57_R <- 8 - lab9data$FSMI57
#lab9data$FSMI58_R <- 8 - lab9data$FSMI58

#If you use the unrecoded items, it will mess up the Cronbach's alpha and lead you to draw wrong conclusion

Alpha(lab9data, "FSMI", c("1", "2", "3_R", "4", "5", "6")) #c is number of items 

#Option 2:
#If you don't want to recode your variable, you can use the shortcut below
Alpha(lab9data, "FSMI", 1:6, rev = 3) 


```
# Exploratory Factor Analysis
```{r}
#In factor analysis, using reverse scored items or not does not make a difference in interpretation. If you use unrecoded items, it will just make the loadings negative 

#EFA on self perception

EFA(lab9data, "FSMI", 1:6, rev = 3, method = "pa", plot.scree = TRUE, nfactors = c("parallel")) #shows that there is only one factor, scale is okay - 1 item not a good predictor PA1 < 0.4

```
# Now test reliability for the status seeking subscale
```{r}
Alpha(lab9data, "FSMI", 31:36, rev = 36) 

```
# Q1: What is the Cronbach's alpha of this subscale? Is it a reliable measure of status seeking? Why? 

The Chronbach's alpha for the status seeking sub scale is 0.830. This is a reliable measure of status seeking because the chronmach alpha is within the acceptable range that the measure has good reliability. 

# Now run a factor analysis on the Mate Retention (Breakup Concern) subscale
```{r}

EFA(lab9data, "FSMI", 49:54, rev = FALSE, method = "pa", plot.scree = TRUE, nfactors = c("parallel"))

```

# Q2: How many factors can you identify from the results? Based on what? What is the range of the factor loadings? What is item that has the highest factor loading? In conclusion, is this a good measure of break up concern and why?

There is only one factor for male retention (breakup concern). This is based on only one factor having an Eigenvalue > 1 (5.015), also because the scree plot only has one factor before it levels off and only one factor above the parallel simulation line. The range of factor loading is 0.823-0.940 with FSMI51 having the highest factor loading "I worry that my romantic/sexual partner might leave me.". In conclusion this is a good measure of break up concern because all of the factor loadings are above good cut off of 0.6.

# Q3: Pick another subscale from FSMI. Test reliability and factor analysis. Answer all the questions  above. 
```{r}

Alpha(lab9data, "FSMI", 13:18, rev = 16) 
EFA(lab9data, "FSMI", 13:18, rev = 16, method = "pa", plot.scree = TRUE, nfactors = c("parallel"))


```
# Q1: What is the Cronbach's alpha of this subscale? Is it a reliable measure of affiliation (group)? Why?

The Chronbach's alpha for the affliation (group) sub-scale is 0.836. This is a good measure of group affiliation because the alpha is above 0.8 which is the criteria for a good reliable measure. 

# Q2: How many factors can you identify from the results? Based on what? What is the range of the factor loadings? What is item that has the highest factor loading? In conclusion, is this a good measure of group affliation and why?

There is one factor for this sub-scale. This is shown by only one factor having an eigenvalue above 1 (3.405), only one factor that is on the slope of the scree plot, and only one factor above the parallel simulation line. The range of factor loading's are 0.427-0.854 where FSMI15 is the highest factor "I like being part of a team". In conclusion this is a okay measure of group affiliation because all the factor loading are above 0.4 which is the acceptable cutoff, two are within the acceptable range of 0.4-0.6, and the rest are above the good cutoff of 0.6.
